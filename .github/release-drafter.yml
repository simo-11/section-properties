# Custom text at start of release

  This release introduces the calculation of the yield moment when material properties
  are applied to the section. The yield moment is calculated as part of the geometric
  analysis with `calculate_geometric_properties()` and can be retrieved with the
  `get_my()` or `get_my_p()` methods.
